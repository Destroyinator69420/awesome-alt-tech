The US technology hegemony is ripe for a shakeup, alt tech is under attack by the biden administration while the republicans choose to attack big tech, the barrier to entry is lower than you think and in terms of technology smaller is better. For example Telegram has only 30 official employees while being a billion dollar unicorn that is doing great. Signal is not very large in terms of headcount either and is doing great as well. Even after being owned by facebook for a decade, whatsapp only has about 15 employees at any one time. These companies are very nimble because of their small size and can adjust quickly if they need to much faster than their larger counterparts. The truth is you can do it too, you must likely won't end up like mark zuckerberg but having your own LLC is cool and you can use the corporate bylaws to claim things you would otherwise buy as a business expense, which is cool. Besides, you get to name the company too. For instane the LLC behind 8kun.top is called "Is it Wet Yet? INC". You could name yours something like "Free Ass Whoopins LLC", "Unlimited Salt Mine Limited", "Macrohard", "Orange Computer", "Electronic Farts", "Roe", "Just Use SQlite - Databases in Action", "Dewey, Cheatem and Howe - Cyberspace Consultants", "Science, Technology, Design and Sales", "blackhat", or a more serious name like users network community support LLC, Planet Communications, or something else.

What does the alt tech landscape look like:

  Messaging Apps:
    - Signal --  Easily the best will known end to end encrypted instant messaging service, endorsed by Edward Snowden and Elon Musk, supports e2ee VOIP and Video calls
    - Session -- Uses the signal encryption protocol, but was forked from signal to connect to the Oxen Service Nodes, also supports VOIP and Video Calls over Oxen Privacy Technology Foundation servers, not the decentralized array of service nodes. No personal information required to sign up. The app attempts to minimise metadata as much as possible.
    - Telegram -- Founded by Pavel Durov with an intense committment to free speech. He fled russia and treveled the world to make it happen. Not as secure as signal, since onlt secret chats are end to end encrypted. Lack of end to end encryption hurts those who opt in to use it as Zcash and Bitcoin mixers have taught us.
    - Discord (depending on who you ask) -- Is not end to end encrypted at all. Paid users get what is easily the best deal as CDNs go. Ironfisted moderation by corporate strangles free expression in the name of kissing up to apple and google along with their chinses shareholders, fosscord is community attempting to reverse enginner discord
    - Element - The closest app to an offical Matrix Client. Basically an end to end encrypted discord alternative once spaces launched
    - Rocket.chat - Not federated, but is easily self hostable and delivered as free software
    - Nextcloud Talk - Integrated into nextcloud as the default instant messenger, easily self hostable as part of the complete nextcloud package
    - SimpleX - P2P messaging app that is end to end encrypted and reqiures no personal information to sign up
    - GNU Jami - A hybrid P2P network for instant messaging, VOIP and Video meetings, P2P with the exception of the Identity servers that connect peers to peers
    - Deltachat - A chat app that uses the email address you already have, trustworthy so long as your email is trustworthy and end to end encrypted as much as standards allow
    - Gab Chat, an offshoot of Gab Social attempting to poach discord customers who do not like discords ironfisted corporate moderation and lack of end to end encryption, messages are deleted once 30 days after posting, much more free speech, although the full version is reserved to Gab Pro subscribers and Gab Shareholders.
    - Zulip, another app in the same genre of self hosted messaging apps to rocket.chat, more focused on business customers
Social Media:
  Microblogging:
    - Mastodon.social and Mastodon.online - the stock mastodon experience on instances ran by the official mastodon nonprofit in germany. Its mastodon covenant restricts free speech in favor of pro left pro democrat pro establishment talking points. The parallel economies developing in the fediverse has caused a left wing echo chamber of sorts, but at least they don't wreck you life over trivial bullshit like happened on twitter pre elon musk era.
    - social.vivaldi.net - also part of the mastodon covenant, in addition promotion of cryptocurrencies or NFTs is not allowed, restricting free speech further, hosted by Vivaldi Technologies in Iceland and moderated by the Vivaldi employees and volunteers. Also developed a left wing echo chamber like mastodon.social and mastodon.online, but its closer proximity to computers and technology releated mastodon servers on the activitypub network makes hanging around worthwhile.
    - Truth Social - Almost the polar opposite of Mastodon, but based on Mastodon and SoapBox so the Truth Social source code is publically available under the GNU AGPL v3 or later. Pretty much a trump echo chamber, but worth it to hear a politically important presidential candidate speak before the MSM blasts out their opinion on what Trump actually said. Lots of high energy and enthusiasm for Trump and Maga, Duh!
    - Gettr, was largely competing with Parler and was the sole survivor of the 'hey trump pick me pick me' war when trump announced truth social. Has a tiktok style feed called Gtok and a referral system to pull people in. Unlike Truth Social it is connected to the rest of the activitypub network to the degree that the mastodon covenent hasn't defederated it.
    - Gab, The OG alt tech microblogging site founded by Andrew Torba, a self proclaimed evangelical christian and gun nut who was fed up with silicon valley. Now it is also a chat app, an AI image generator via its Gab Art bot, a payment processor after they were cut off from the finincial system and activly solicits private equity from its customers through the 2012 jobs act up to 1.02 million a year last time I checked instead of through private equity firms and outside investment.
    - Brighteon.social, Pretty much mastodon with a brighteon theme that makes money by shilling alternative health books and pushing signup to brighteon the video sharing site on those who cannot make it through the application process.
    - Mozilla.social - Looks to be a pretty normal mastodon server run by Mozilla, still invite only and Mozilla is too bogged down by social media safety, user research and beaurcracy to launch immediately like any individual or small business can do without these things. They are more than perfectly capable of handling the bandwidth too, so I think they are stalling on purpose to pump up hype for mozilla social artificially, basically the clubhouse strategy.

                                                                          More Soon ;)
