The US technology hegemony is ripe for a shakeup, alt tech is under attack by the biden administration while the republicans choose to attack big tech, the barrier to entry is lower than you think and in terms of technology smaller is better. For example Telegram has only 30 official employees while being a billion dollar unicorn that is doing great. Signal is not very large in terms of headcount either and is doing great as well. Even after being owned by facebook for a decade, whatsapp only has about 15 employees at any one time. These companies are very nimble because of their small size and can adjust quickly if they need to much faster than their larger counterparts. The truth is you can do it too, you must likely won't end up like mark zuckerberg but having your own LLC is cool and you can use the corporate bylaws to claim things you would otherwise buy as a business expense, which is cool. Besides, you get to name the company too. For instane the LLC behind 8kun.top is called "Is it Wet Yet? INC". You could name yours something like "Free Ass Whoopins LLC", "Unlimited Salt Mine Limited", "Macrohard", "Orange Computer", "Electronic Farts", "Roe", "Just Use SQlite - Databases in Action", "Dewey, Cheatem and Howe - Cyberspace Consultants", "Science, Technology, Design and Sales", "blackhat", or a more serious name like users network community support LLC, Planet Communications, or something else.
